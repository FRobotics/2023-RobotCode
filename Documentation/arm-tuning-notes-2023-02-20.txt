arm tuning

	- lift
		kp -- increase to approx 1/10.
		decrease pos tolerance to 1

	- extend
		can probably decrease error db to 0.2
		decrease error threshold to say 6
		increase max motor output to 0.65 to 0.75
		

	- rotate
		increase error deadband to 0.5 (or maybe 1.0)
		see how it responds..... FIRST
		maybe decrease err threshold to 10
		maybe increase max output to 0.4
