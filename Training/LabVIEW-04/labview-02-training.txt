	X numeric data types
		integer32 -- whole numbers
		double ( 64 bit ) -- 
		- right click on control or indicator select data type.
		- automatic conversion -- not always your friend.

	X enumerated variables
		- what are they  (integer values with names)
		- creating custom data type


	X while loop
		- counter (starts at zero)
		- terminator
			- logic, executes last

	X while loop wait

	X remembering data between loops

---------------------------------------------------------------------

	- case statements
		- layers of conditional execution
		- terminals out of all have to be assigned.
		- terminals into don't always have to be used
		- ? can be boolean or numeric or string
		- for numeric - enumerated values work best!!
		

----------------------------------

	- array data type
		- list of the same kind of information
		- indexing always starts at zero.
		- can have more than one dimension (2 dim array can also be matricies)

			- 

	- things in and out of loops..


	- cluster data type
		- group individual pieces of data together.
